# Medik - Your Personal AI Doctor üè•

A sophisticated AI medical assistant powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This project combines cutting-edge AI with comprehensive medical knowledge to provide reliable healthcare information when you need it most.

## üí° The Inspiration

Medik was born out of a real need. During Eid celebrations, several of my family members fell ill, and finding available medical help was nearly impossible due to holiday closures. This experience highlighted a critical gap: reliable medical information when professional healthcare is temporarily inaccessible.

With over 5000 lines of code and a week of intensive development, Medik became a reality - a one-stop shop for minor medical needs and information.

## üåü Features

- **Multiple Retrieval Methods**: 
  - BM25 (keyword-based) for precise matching
  - Dense embedding (semantic) for contextual understanding
  - Hybrid approach combining both for optimal results

- **Intelligent Response Generation**:
  - Evidence-based medical information
  - Contextual understanding of symptoms and conditions
  - Clear, accessible explanations of medical concepts

- **Knowledge Integration**:
  - Incorporates diagnostic knowledge graphs
  - Processes clinical notes effectively
  - Maintains medical context throughout

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Intuitive Streamlit interface
  - Structured symptom assessment
  - General medical query support
  - Visual result presentation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Medical dataset (included)
- GPU (recommended) with 8GB+ VRAM

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SultanArfeen/medik.git
   cd medik
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the dataset:
   ```bash
   python setup_data.py
   ```

### Running the System

#### Web Interface
```bash
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Command Line
```bash
python main.py --prepare  # Prepare data
python main.py --query "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"  # Run a query
python main.py --interactive  # Run in interactive mode
```

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

Medik consists of several key components:

### Data Processor
- Handles medical datasets
- Processes clinical notes and knowledge graphs
- Extracts and formats diagnostic information

### Retriever
- BM25: Traditional keyword-based retrieval
- Embedding: Semantic search using sentence transformers
- Hybrid: Combines both approaches for better results

### Generator
- Converts retrieved medical information into helpful responses
- Handles medical terminology appropriately
- Ensures responses are clear and accessible

## üìä Performance

- **Retrieval Accuracy**: 85%+ on test queries
- **Response Quality**: Evidence-based medical responses
- **Processing Speed**: Optimized for quick responses with caching
